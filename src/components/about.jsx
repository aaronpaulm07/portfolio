            <p1 className='para'>I'm a computer science engineering student pursuing my Bachelor's 
            degree from Cochin University. With a passion for technology, I have completed an internship in web development, 
            where I worked with HTML, CSS, C/C++, and JavaScript. I am also proficient in React and have completed a course on 
            Python data analysis from LinkedIn Learning.
            <br/>
            While I enjoy the technical aspects of programming, my ultimate goal is to explore the creative side of technology. 
            I am particularly interested in UI/UX design and analysis, where I can use my technical skills to create engaging 
            and user-friendly interfaces.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Aside from my academic pursuits, I am a highly ambitious and organized individual who is always seeking new challenges 
            and opportunities to grow. I have a passion for traveling and exploring new places, which has broadened my horizons and 
            helped me develop a unique perspective.</p1>
