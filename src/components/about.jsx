            <p1 className='para'>As a recent graduate, I am highly interested in the fields of data analytics, UI/UX design, 
            and front end development. With a strong foundation in HTML/CSS, React, Figma, Python, and SQL, I am equipped to
             tackle diverse projects and create user-centered experiences. I am passionate about leveraging data to drive
             insights and decision-making while also focusing on creating intuitive and visually appealing interfaces.
             With a thirst for knowledge and a drive to excel, I am excited to contribute my skills and make a meaningful
             impact in the industry.
             <br/>
             I'm always happy to connect with new people to share my experiences and also learn from them.
